Figure out what is meant with Device Parameter List (might be easier when I have the physical device). Most likely I can use Default Configuration iM871A if i get impatient.

Then implement:
GetDeviceConfigurationResponse
SetDeviceConfigurationRequest


Find a better strategy than marker interfaces!

go through xml doc for classes. Might suffer from copypaste-syndrome.

some how find a way to share extension methods across projects (need wmbus extensions for tostrings). Don't really want to use nuget.. Lets see.
