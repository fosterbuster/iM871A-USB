# iM871A-USB
.NET Client for communication with the iM871A-USB.

## Notice.
This is a WIP, please do not consider it done. If using .NET Core 3 - it should work on a raspberry pi when done.

.. should also work with the chip itself, but this wont be tested.

For access to my wmbus parser library, give me a shout.
