# iM871A-USB
.NET Library for communicating with the WiMOD iM871A USB (and the chip) WMBus dongle.

## Notice.
This is a WIP, please do not consider it done. If using .NET Core 3 - it should work on a raspberry pi when done.

.. should also work with the chip itself, but this wont be tested.

For access to my wmbus parser library, give me a shout.
